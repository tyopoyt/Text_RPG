There is one word that stands the test of time and holds fast to the center of everything.

It belongs to everyone, to all living things, but no one can master it.
The word is?

My days are in the summer
When you'll eat me when I'm hot
In fact I'll even eat myself
Where battles tough are fought
But when you find me in a fight
'Twill be high in the sky
And if you catch me napping
I suggest you let me lie
When you're bad come to my house
From Ma get thoughts profound
Am I big or am I small?
Some say I'm just a pound.

Four of us are in your field
But our differences keep us at yield
First, a one that is no fool
Though he resembles a gardener's tool

And truancy makes it grow fonder
Last, a stem connecting dots of three
